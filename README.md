# Komodo sync-api utility

## TL;DR

This sync-API deploys automatically via telegram kmd-sync-bot --> https://github.com/dathbezumniy/kmd-sync-bot

## Pre-phase
This api and telegram kmd-sync-bot are in the very early development stage, so the security of the whole thing is a big question and if you notice any bugs or issues please let me know here via issues or at komodo discord channel @dth. If you need any guidance on how to add features/configure or you want to propose an improvement please do not hesitate.

For now both bot and api tested only on: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS bionic


## Installation

If for some unknown to me reason you would like to install this API without the help of our utility telegram bot then there's a simple .sh script that you can use.

```sh
"wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dathbezumniy/kmd-sync-api/master/sync_api_setup.sh && chmod u+x sync_api_setup.sh && ./sync_api_setup.sh"
```


## Manual routine if something goes wrong:
Check if supervisord and sync-api started properly:
```sh 
ps aux | grep python 
```
If you do not see sync-api.py running then you should check supervisord or api error log:

```sh
cat logs/sync-api.err.log
cat logs/supervisord.log
```

If you fixed the problem then start api again with:

```sh
supervisorctl start sync-api
supervisorctl stop sync-api
supervisorctl restart sync-api
```

If you cant figure the problem out, do not hesitate to paste this error message to me @dth on discord komodo channel or simply open up an issue here. If you have any ideas on what should be done to make this bot even better, let me know.


## Using sync-API

After successful installation, you(or basically anyone else who knows the ip of your sync-api server) will be able to call these api-endpoints:
